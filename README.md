# Customer Retention & Cohort Analysis (E-commerce)

## Overview
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior to understand retention,
churn patterns, and long term revenue contribution.

The goal is to move beyond dashboards and demonstrate backend analytical
thinking using SQL and Python.

## Business Questions
- How does customer retention change over time?
- Which cohorts generate long term value?
- Are we dependent on early or repeat customers?
- Where does revenue decay occur in the customer lifecycle?

## Tools Used
- SQL (cohort logic, window functions)
- Python (EDA & validation)
- Power BI (final visualization)
